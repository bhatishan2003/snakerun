## Development Notes

-   For development (editable mode), do following installation:

    -   Core only:

        ```bash
        pip install -e .
        ```

    -   With tests:
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[test]
        ```
    -   With dev tools:

        ```bash
        pip install -e .[dev]
        ```

    -   All dependencies (test + dev):
        ```bash
        pip install -e .[all]
        ```

-   Pre-commit

    We use pre-commit to automate linting of our codebase.

    -   Install hooks:
        ```bash
        pre-commit install
        ```
    -   Run Hooks manually (optional):
        ```bash
        pre-commit run --all-files
        ```

-   Ruff:

    -   Lint and format:
        ```bash
        ruff check --fix
        ruff format
        ```

## Testing

Run following command to check test cases.

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
pytest -v
```

## Versioning

We use [bump-my-version](https://github.com/callowayproject/bump-my-version) to manage version numbers consistently.

### Install

```bash
pip install .[dev]
```

### Bump Version Options

-   Patch (bug fixes, backward compatible):

    ```bash
    bump-my-version bump patch
    ```

-   Minor (new features, backward compatible):

    ```bash
    bump-my-version bump minor
    ```

-   Major (breaking changes):

    ```bash
    bump-my-version bump major
    ```

## Release Notes

-   Always run test cases.
-   Install twine/build dependancies
    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade build twine
    ```
-   Build
    ```bash
    python -m build
    ```
